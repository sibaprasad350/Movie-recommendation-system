## Movie-recommendation-system:

### Introduction:
The Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based project utilizing machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. The system is built on collaborative filtering, a common approach in recommendation systems.

### Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive development environment for data exploration and analysis.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Employed for implementing machine learning algorithms.

#### Dataset
The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of recommendation systems. This dataset contains movie ratings and user information, making it suitable for collaborative filtering.

## Project Workflow
Data Preparation:
Load and merge the MovieLens dataset, extracting relevant information such as movie ratings and genres.

#### Data Exploration:
Analyze and preprocess the dataset to gain insights into average ratings, the number of ratings per movie, and other relevant statistics.

#### Building the Recommendation Model:
Create a user-item matrix to represent user preferences.
Apply collaborative filtering techniques, such as cosine similarity, to find movies similar to the user's preferences.

#### Recommendation Function:
Develop a function that takes a movie title and user rating as input, providing a list of recommended movies based on similarity scores.
Movie Recommendation System is a filtration strategy using content-based filtering for recommending movie using ML algorithms. Movie can be recommended by using vectorization method.
